# Outdoor Dreams VA: Hero & Nav Clone

This project is a pixel-perfect clone of the navigation bar and hero section from [Outdoor Dreams](https://www.outdoordreamsva.com).

## Strategy & Planing 

- Add tailwindcss CDN
- Copy resources (logo, theme, images, fonts) 
- What animations is needed and how it is done is there animations in mobile design?
- Build HTML structure
- Difference between Desktop and mobile designs?
- Is there reusable components?

## Setup

1. Clone or download this repo.
2. Open `index.html` in any browser (no server needed).
3. Resize your browser to test breakpoints:
   - **Desktop** ≥ 1024px (navigation horizontally displayed)
   - **Mobile** ≤ 425px (hamburger menu appears)
4. All styling is inlined via TailwindCSS CDN.
